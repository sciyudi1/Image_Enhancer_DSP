# Image Enhancer v1.1

An *Open-Source*, **PythonQt5 based Desktop App** for up-scaling images using **state-of-the-art GAN** techniques.

## What's New ?

Well, let's talk about it in upcoming updates :wink:

* As of now, we just have a new PopUp Window when you click the upscaled image. So you can now look/review the upscaled image closely before saving it !

## How To Run ? (I'll deploy this soon, but for now...)

* Clone this repo :
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sudoRicheek/Image-Enhancer.git
  cd Image-Enhancer
  ```

* Run the python script **Run.py** :
  ```
  python run.py
  ```
  
## Some Working Photos :)

## Plans For Next Update

* Set up **check boxes, for selecting the type of object in the image**, for increasing the specificity of the type of Neural Network to be used.

* Find and implement SOTA models for image upscaling.

* Other minor tweaks. Can't really think of anything now :grin:
